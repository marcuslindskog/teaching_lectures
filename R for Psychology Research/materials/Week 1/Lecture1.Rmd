# What is R?
---
# What is R?

- Statistical programming language.

- An implementation of the S programming language.

- An interpreted language.

- Developed by *R Development Core Team*
---
# What is R?

- R is free.

- A major version comes out once a year.

- 2-3 minor releases each year.

- Anyone can contribute to R by writing a *package*.

- There are currently more than 15 000 packages available.
---
# aRe we set up?

- R can be found at the *comprehensive R archive network* https://cran.r-project.org

- Rstudio can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/

- Make sure you keep R and Rstudio updated with the latest version.

# Becoming familiar with RStudio
---

# Say hello to Rstudio
- You can use R directly from its console.

- But, Rstudio makes your life much easier.

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE).

# The console

- The console in R works just like a calculator.

- Anything you type after ` > `  will be evaluated.

- R uses the ` # ` sign for comments. Anything you add after ` # ` will not run as R code.

- Commenting your code using ` # ` is **very** important!

# Variables, operators, and data structures

---

# Arithmetic operators in R
- Addition: ` + `

- Subtraction:  ` - ` 

- Multiplication: ` * ` 

- Division: ` / `

- Exponentiation: ` ^ or ** `

- Modulo: ` %% `
---
# Let's try

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Addition
6 + 8

# Subtraction
9 - 15

# Multiplication
10 * 4
```
---
# Let's try
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Division
10 / 4

# Exponentiation
3^2

3**2

#Modulo
5 %% 2
```
---
# Variable assignment
- R let's you store values (e.g. 4) and objects (e.g. a function) in variables.

- What you have store can be accessed using the variables name.

- A value (or object) is assigned to a variable using ` <- `

```{r, eval = FALSE }
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer <- 42

# Access the value assigned to the_answer
the_answer
```
---
# Variable operations
- Arithmetic operations works on variables.

- An answer can be assigned to new variables.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer <- 42

# Assign 15 to extra_everything
extra_everything <- 15

# Calculate sum of the_answer and extra_everything
the_answer + extra_everything

# Assign sum to new variable
new_truth <- the_answer + extra_everything
```
---
# Variable assignment

- Variable assignment is not limited to integers.

- R allows you to assign various *data types* to variables.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer <- 42L

# Assign 42.76 to exact_answer
exact_answer <- 42.76

# Assign "question" to answer_to_what
answer_to_what <- "question"

# Assign FALSE to the_truth
the_truth <- FALSE
```
---
# Data types in R

- character: ` "a", "swc" `

- numeric: ` 2, 15.5 ` 

- integer: ` 2L ` 

- logical: ` TRUE, FALSE `

- (complex: ` 1+4i `)
---
# What data type?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Assign 42 to the_answer
class(the_answer)

# Assign 42.76 to exact_answer
class(exact_answer)

# Assign "question" to answer_to_what
class(answer_to_what)

# Assign FALSE to the_truth
class(the_truth)
```
---
# Do we need to care?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Difference between the_answer and exact_answer
exact_answer-the_answer

# Difference between the_answer and the_truth
the_truth-the_answer

# Difference between answer_to_what and exact_answer
answer_to_what - the_answer
```

# Data structures
---
# More than one data point?
- R let's you store collections of data points in various data structures.

- We will look at:
  - Vectors
  - Matrices
  - Data frames
  - Lists
---
class: inverted, middle, center
# Vectors
---
# Vectors
- One dimensional collection of data.

- Can only contain data of the same type.

- Vectors are created with the ` combine ` fuction ` c() `

```{r, eval = FALSE}
numeric_vector <- c(8, 7, 6, 5, 4)

charcter_vector <- c("x", "y", "z", "t")

boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
---
# Naming a vector
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Your daily coffee consumption

coffee_cups <- c(6, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 4)

names(coffee_cups) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
                        "Sunday")

coffee_cups
```
---
# Getting lazy
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Your daily coffee consumption

coffee_cups <- c(6, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 4)

week_days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
               "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
               "Sunday")
 
names(coffee_cups) <- week_days

coffee_cups
```
---
# Arithmetic on vectors
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Your daily coffee consumption
coffee_cups_w34 <- c(6, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 4)
coffee_cups_w35 <- c(4, 7, 6, 9, 0, 8, 6)

names(coffee_cups_w34) <- week_days
names(coffee_cups_w35) <- week_days

two_week_cups <- coffee_cups_w34 + coffee_cups_w35

names(two_week_cups) <- week_days

two_week_cups
```
---
# More arithmetics
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Total cups
sum(two_week_cups)

#Mean cups
mean(two_week_cups)

#Average daily cups
two_week_cups / 2
```
---
# Logical operators
- Less than: `<`

- Less than or equal: `<=`

- Greater than: `>`

- Greater than or equal: `>=`

- Exactly qual to: `==`

- Not equal to: `!=`

- Not y: `!y`

- x OR y: `x|y`

- x AND y: `x&y`
---
# Logical operators
```{r, eval = TRUE}
2 < 4

3 > 5

6 == 8

"dog" == "dog"
```
---
# Logic on vectors
```{r, eval = TRUE}
coffee_cups_w34 <- c(6, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 4)
coffee_cups_w35 <- c(4, 7, 6, 9, 0, 8, 6)

# Your daily coffee consumption
coffee_cups_w34 > coffee_cups_w35

coffee_cups_w34 == coffee_cups_w35

coffee_cups_w34 > 6

coffee_cups_w35 != 6
```

# Vector selection

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Your daily coffee consumption
monday_coffee <- coffee_cups_w34[1]

monday_coffee

weekend_coffee <- coffee_cups_w35[c(6,7)]
weekend_coffee

```

# Vector selection using logic

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Your daily coffee consumption
high_volume <- coffee_cups_w34[coffee_cups_w34 >= 6]

high_volume

low_volume <- coffee_cups_w35[coffee_cups_w35 < 6]

low_volume
```

# Matricies
---

# Matricies
- Two dimensional (row, column) data structure.

- Can only contain one data type
---
# Matrix assignment
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Generate 4 x 5 numeric matrix 
y<-matrix(1:20, nrow=4,ncol=5)

y

cell_values <- c(1,26,24,68, 32, 99)
row_names <- c("Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3")
column_names <- c("Col 1", "Col 2") 
my_matrix <- matrix(cell_values, nrow=3, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,

y[,4]

# 3rd row of matrix 
y[3,] 

# rows 2,3,4 of columns 1,2,3

# What does this do?
y[y[,4] > 14,]

```

class: inverted, middle, center
# Data frames
---
# Data frames
- Two dimensional data structure.

- Allows columns to be of different data types.

- Columns must be of same length.

- Similar to data sheet in standard statistical software.
---

# Data frame assignment
```{r, eval = FALSE}
var_1 <- c(49, 32, 24, 23, 43)
var_2 <- c("m", "f", "f", "m", "m")
var_3 <- c(102, 110, 123, 98, 112)
var_4 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

the_data <- data.frame(var_1, var_2, var_3, var_4)
```
---
# Variable names
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Option 1
the_data <- data.frame(Age = var_1, Sex = var_2,
                       IQ = var_3, Bool = var_4)

#Option 2
names(the_data) <- c("Age", "Sex", "IQ", "Bool")

```
---
# Access data
- There are three ways to access the data in a data frame.

1. Subscript: `the_data[3:4]`
2. Names: `the_data[c("Age","IQ")]`
3. dollar-notation: `the_data$Age`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Option 1
the_data[,3:4]

#Option 2
the_data[c("Age","IQ")]

#Option 3
the_data$Age
```
---
# Overview of the data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(the_data, 2)

tail(the_data, 2)

str(the_data)

summary(the_data)
```
---
# Subset data frame
- Using `subset()` you can select a portion of your data frame.

- `subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
subset(the_data, Age > 25)
```
---
# Adding a variable
```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_variable <- c(78, 98, 56, 22, 12)
the_data$New <- new_variable
str(the_data)
```
---
# Removing a variable
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Option 1
the_data[,-c(2:3)]

# Option 2
subset(the_data, select = -c(Sex, IQ))

# Option 3
the_data[,!names(the_data) %in% c("Sex", "IQ")]
```

class: inverted, middle, center
# Lists
---

# Lists

- Lists is the most flexible data structure in R

- It can basically contain anything.

- It helps us collect things in a structured way.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
our_list <- list(matrix(3:14, nrow = 4), y, coffee_cups_w34)
our_list
```
---
# Naming a list

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(our_list) <- c("M1", "M2", "Coffee")
our_list
```
---
## Accessing list items 1
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Option 1
our_list[[1]]

our_list[[1]][2]

# Option 2
our_list$Coffee

our_list$Coffee[1]
```

# Scripts
- During this lecture we've written all our code in the console.

- This is not very practical in the long run. 

- A better way is to collect all relevant code in a script.

- Let's have a look at how you do that in Rstudio.
