# What is R?
---
# What is R?

- Statistical programming language.

- An implementation of the S programming language.

- An interpreted language.

- Developed by *R Development Core Team*
---
# What is R?

- R is free.

- A major version comes out once a year.

- 2-3 minor releases each year.

- Anyone can contribute to R by writing a *package*.

- There are currently more than 15 000 packages available.
---
# aRe we set up?

- R can be found at the *comprehensive R archive network* https://cran.r-project.org

- Rstudio can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/

- Make sure you keep R and Rstudio updated with the latest version.

# Becoming familiar with RStudio
---

# Say hello to Rstudio
- You can use R directly from its console.

- But, Rstudio makes your life much easier.

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE).

# The console

- The console in R works just like a calculator.

- Anything you type after ` &gt; `  will be evaluated.

- R uses the ` # ` sign for comments. Anything you add after ` # ` will not run as R code.

- Commenting your code using ` # ` is **very** important!

# Variables, operators, and data structures

---

# Arithmetic operators in R
- Addition: ` + `

- Subtraction:  ` - ` 

- Multiplication: ` * ` 

- Division: ` / `

- Exponentiation: ` ^ or ** `

- Modulo: ` %% `
---
# Let's try


```r
# Addition
6 + 8

# Subtraction
9 - 15

# Multiplication
10 * 4
```
---
# Let's try

```r
# Division
10 / 4

# Exponentiation
3^2

3**2

#Modulo
5 %% 2
```
---
# Variable assignment
- R let's you store values (e.g. 4) and objects (e.g. a function) in variables.

- What you have store can be accessed using the variables name.

- A value (or object) is assigned to a variable using ` &lt;- `


```r
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer &lt;- 42

# Access the value assigned to the_answer
the_answer
```
---
# Variable operations
- Arithmetic operations works on variables.

- An answer can be assigned to new variables.



```r
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer &lt;- 42

# Assign 15 to extra_everything
extra_everything &lt;- 15

# Calculate sum of the_answer and extra_everything
the_answer + extra_everything

# Assign sum to new variable
new_truth &lt;- the_answer + extra_everything
```
---
# Variable assignment

- Variable assignment is not limited to integers.

- R allows you to assign various *data types* to variables.


```r
# Assign 42 to the_answer
the_answer &lt;- 42L

# Assign 42.76 to exact_answer
exact_answer &lt;- 42.76

# Assign "question" to answer_to_what
answer_to_what &lt;- "question"

# Assign FALSE to the_truth
the_truth &lt;- FALSE
```
---
# Data types in R

- character: ` "a", "swc" `

- numeric: ` 2, 15.5 ` 

- integer: ` 2L ` 

- logical: ` TRUE, FALSE `

- (complex: ` 1+4i `)
---
# What data type?

```r
# Assign 42 to the_answer
class(the_answer)

# Assign 42.76 to exact_answer
class(exact_answer)

# Assign "question" to answer_to_what
class(answer_to_what)

# Assign FALSE to the_truth
class(the_truth)
```
---
# Do we need to care?


```r
# Difference between the_answer and exact_answer
exact_answer-the_answer

# Difference between the_answer and the_truth
the_truth-the_answer

# Difference between answer_to_what and exact_answer
answer_to_what - the_answer
```

# Data structures
---
# More than one data point?
- R let's you store collections of data points in various data structures.

- We will look at:
  - Vectors
  - Matrices
  - Data frames
  - Lists
---
class: inverted, middle, center
# Vectors
---
# Vectors
- One dimensional collection of data.

- Can only contain data of the same type.

- Vectors are created with the ` combine ` fuction ` c() `


```r
numeric_vector &lt;- c(8, 7, 6, 5, 4)

charcter_vector &lt;- c("x", "y", "z", "t")

boolean_vector &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
---

```r
# Your daily coffee consumption

                        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
                        "Sunday")

# Arithmetic on vectors

```r
# Your daily coffee consumption
coffee_cups_w34 &lt;- c(6, 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 4)
coffee_cups_w35 &lt;- c(4, 7, 6, 9, 0, 8, 6)

names(coffee_cups_w34) &lt;- week_days
names(coffee_cups_w35) &lt;- week_days

two_week_cups &lt;- coffee_cups_w34 + coffee_cups_w35

names(two_week_cups) &lt;- week_days

two_week_cups
```
---
# More arithmetics

```r
#Total cups
sum(two_week_cups)

#Mean cups
mean(two_week_cups)

#Average daily cups
two_week_cups / 2
```

# Logical operators
- Less than: `&lt;`

- Less than or equal: `&lt;=`

- Exactly qual to: `==`

- Not equal to: `!=`

- Not y: `!y`

- x OR y: `x|y`

- x AND y: `x&amp;y`

# Matricies

# Matricies
- Two dimensional (row, column) data structure.

- Can only contain one data type
---
# Matrix assignment

```r
# Generate 4 x 5 numeric matrix 
y&lt;-matrix(1:20, nrow=4,ncol=5)

y

cell_values &lt;- c(1,26,24,68, 32, 99)

```

# Matrix selection

class: inverted, middle, center
# Data frames
---
# Data frames
- Two dimensional data structure.

- Allows columns to be of different data types.

- Columns must be of same length.

- Similar to data sheet in standard statistical software.
---

# Data frame assignment

```r
var_1 &lt;- c(49, 32, 24, 23, 43)
var_2 &lt;- c("m", "f", "f", "m", "m")
var_3 &lt;- c(102, 110, 123, 98, 112)
var_4 &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

the_data &lt;- data.frame(var_1, var_2, var_3, var_4)
```
---
# Variable names

```r
#Option 1
the_data &lt;- data.frame(Age = var_1, Sex = var_2,
                       IQ = var_3, Bool = var_4)

#Option 2
names(the_data) &lt;- c("Age", "Sex", "IQ", "Bool")
```
---
# Access data
- There are three ways to access the data in a data frame.

1. Subscript: `the_data[3:4]`
2. Names: `the_data[c("Age","IQ")]`
3. dollar-notation: `the_data$Age`


```r
#Option 1
the_data[,3:4]

#Option 2
the_data[c("Age","IQ")]

#Option 3
the_data$Age
```
---
# Overview of the data

```r
head(the_data, 2)

tail(the_data, 2)

str(the_data)

summary(the_data)
```
---
# Subset data frame
- Using `subset()` you can select a portion of your data frame.

- `subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)`

```r
subset(the_data, Age &gt; 25)
```
---
# Adding a variable

```r
new_variable &lt;- c(78, 98, 56, 22, 12)
the_data$New &lt;- new_variable
str(the_data)
```
---
# Removing a variable

```r
#Option 1
the_data[,-c(2:3)]

# Option 2
subset(the_data, select = -c(Sex, IQ))

# Option 3
the_data[,!names(the_data) %in% c("Sex", "IQ")]
```
---
class: inverted, middle, center
# Lists
---

# Lists

- Lists is the most flexible data structure in R

- It can basically contain anything.

- It helps us collect things in a structured way.


```r
our_list &lt;- list(matrix(3:14, nrow = 4), y, coffee_cups_w34)
our_list
```
---
# Naming a list


```r
names(our_list) &lt;- c("M1", "M2", "Coffee")
our_list
```
---
## Accessing list items 1

```r
#Option 1
our_list[[1]]

our_list[[1]][2]

# Option 2
our_list$Coffee

our_list$Coffee[1]
```

# Scripts
---
# Scripts
- During this lecture we've written all our code in the console.

- This is not very practical in the long run. 

- A better way is to collect all relevant code in a script.

- Let's have a look at how you do that in Rstudio.
