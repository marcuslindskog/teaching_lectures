# Control flow and conditionals
---

# Control flow
1. In programming you often your code to make a decision...
--

1. ...or you want your code to run, until a condition is met.
--

1. This can be achieved with control flow.
---
# How can you control the flow of your code

1. `if...else`:  to make a decision
--

1. `for - loop`: to iterate over a vector
--

1. `while - loop`: to run your code until a condition is met.
---

# `if...else`
---
# `if...else`

- You often run into the problem of wanting to run a specific piece of code if a condition is met, but not otherwise.
--

- Such decisions are best handled in R with the `if...else` statement.
--

- Basic syntax:

--
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(test_expression){
  statement
}
```
--
- If the `test_expression` is `TRUE` the `statement` will be executed. If it is `FALSE` it will not.

# Let's try

```{r, eval = FALSE}

x <- 5


if(x > 0){
  print("Positive number")
}

```

--
- See what happens with your code when `x` is changed.
---
# If...else

* Sometimes you know what you want the code to do if the `if` - statement is not met.

--

* In such cases you can also add an `else` statement.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

if(test_expression){
  true_statement
} else {
  false_statement
}

```

--

* Here, the `true_statement` will execute if `test_expression` is `TRUE` and the `false_statement` will execute if it is `FALSE`

x <- -5

if(x > 0){
  print("Non-negative number")
} else {
  print("Negative number")
}
```
---
# `if...else` ladder
* Sometimes you have more than two conditions to check for.
--

* This can be achieved with a `if...else` ladder.

--
```{r, eval = FALSE}

if(test_exp1){
  statement1
} else if (test_exp2) {
  statement2
} else if(test_exp3){
  statement3
} else 
  statement4
}

```
---
# Let's try 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 0

if (x < 0) {
  print("Negative number")
} else if (x > 0) {
  print("Positive number")
} else{
  print("Zero")
}
```
---
# The function `ifelse()`

* Using the full `if...else` we saw above is a powerful way to make decisions.
--

* But sometimes you just want something that can re-code a variable.

--

* For that we have the `ifelse()` function

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ifelse(test, yes, no)

x <- 8

y <- ifelse(x < 9, 1, 0)

```
---

# `for` - loop
---
# `for` - loop

* The `for` - loop is used to iterate over a vector.

--
* For each item in the vector, the body of the for loop is executed.

--

* This is an efficient way to carry out an operation a predefined number of times. That is, when you know how many times you want something to happen.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (val in sequence) {
  statement
}
```

--

* Here `val` is each value in `sequence`. During each iteration, `statement` is executed.

# Let's try

```{r, eval = FALSE}

vec <- 1:20

for(val in  vec){
  if(val %% 2 == 0){
    print(paste(val, "is even even"))
  } else{
    print(paste(val, "is even odd"))
  }
}

# `while` - loop
---
# `while` - loop

* What if you don't know for how long you want to iterate?

--
* Or if you don't have a vector to iterate over?

--

* Then you should use a `while` - loop

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while(test_expression){
  statement
}
```

--

* Here, `statement` gets executed over and over again, until `test_expression` becomes `FALSE`.

--

* Put differently, the loop continues as long as `test_expression` is `TRUE`

--

* Be careful, if your `test_expression` never becomes `FALSE`, the loop never stops.

---
# `break`

* `break` can be used to break a loop.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 1:5

for (val in x) {
  if (val == 3){
    break
  }
  print(val)
}
```

---
# `next`

* `next` can be used to skip an iteration of a loop.
--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

x <- 1:5

for (val in x) {
  if (val == 3){
    next
  }
  print(val)
}

# Functions

# Functions

* Functions are an efficient way to automate common tasks.

--
* You have already bumped into several of the *built in* functions in R e.g.,
  * `c()`
  * `str()`
  * `ifelse()`
  * `mean()`
  
--

* R also allows you to write your own functions

--
* Consider writing a function when you've copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.

# Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(psych)

my_data <- bfi

se_A1 <- sd(my_data$A1, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A1)))

se_A2 <- sd(my_data$A2, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A2)))

se_A3 <- sd(my_data$A3, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A1)))

se_A4 <- sd(my_data$A4, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A4)))

```

---
# Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(psych)

my_data <- bfi

se_A1 <- sd(my_data$A1, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A1)))

se_A2 <- sd(my_data$A2, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A2)))

se_A3 <- sd(my_data$A3, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A1))) #<<

se_A4 <- sd(my_data$A4, na.rm = TRUE)/
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(my_data$A4)))

```
---
# `function` - me!

```{r, eval = FALSE}

x <- my_data$A1

sd_x <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
sqrt_length_x <- sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))
sd_x / sqrt_length_x
```

--
* How many inputs do we have to this code?

---
# Function syntax

```{r, eval = FALSE}

func_name <- function (argument) {
  statement
}

```
---
# `function` - me!

```{r, eval = TRUE}
standard_error <- function(x){
    sd_x <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    sqrt_length_x <- sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))
    sd_x / sqrt_length_x
}
```
--
* This function lives in your global environment as an object. Note that we have assigned the function statement to the variable `standard_error`


--
* If you **clean your environment**, you will need to assign it again.

--

* If you **change anything in your function**, you will need to assign it again.

---
# Three key steps

1. Pick a name for your function. Make it a good one.
--

1. List the *arguments* inside `function`.
--

1. Place the code you've developed inside the body block `{ }`
--

* Don't write your function until you can make your code work on simple input.

---
# Check your function on a few outputs.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
se_A1 <- standard_error(my_data$A1)

se_A2 <- standard_error(my_data$A2)

se_A3 <- standard_error(my_data$A3)

se_A4 <- standard_error(my_data$A4)

```
---
# Function arguments

* Arguments are the objects you pass to a function.

--
* They come in two broad classes:
  * **data** to compute on.
  * **details** of the computation.
  
--

* Generally, **data** argument should come first.

--

* **Detail** arguments should come at the end and have default values.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Compute confidence interval around 
# mean using normal approximation

mean_ci <- function(x, conf = 0.95){ #<<
  se <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
  alpha <- 1 - conf
  mean(x) + se*qnorm(c(alpha/2, 1-alpha/2))
  
}

```
---
# What is returned?
* The value returned by a function is usually the last statement it evaluates.

--
* If the last line of your function is what you want returned. You don't need an explicit `return` statement.

--
* On occasion, you might want to return values early, or be super obvious what is returned from your code.

--

* This can be done with the `return()` function

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
standard_error <- function(x){
    sd_x <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    sqrt_length_x <- sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))
    return(sd_x / sqrt_length_x) #<<
}
```
---
# Checking values
* If you have functions that where arguments need to have certain properties, it is good practice to check those properties.

--
* You also want to let the user know, if an argument does not have a certain property and through an error.

--
* This is done with the `stop()` function.

---
# Let's try
```{r, eval = FALSE}

two_vector_function <- function(x, y){
  if(length(x) != length(y)){
    stop("'x' and 'y' must be of the same length",
         call. = FALSE)
    }
  (x + y)^2
}

x <- c(2, 3, 4)
y <- c(4, 5)
two_vector_function(x,y)

y <- c(4, 5, 9)
two_vector_function(x,y)

```
---
# A few thoughts on naming
* Your function is both for the computer and for you. Name it properly.

--
* Use a short name that clearly states what the function does.

--
* Use a verb for your function name and a noun for arguments.

--
* Choose a convention and stick with it.
  * `snake_case`
  * `camleCase`


--
* Make sure you comment your code properly (`#`)

---
# Environment
* Let's begin with an example

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}

a <- 10

assign_value_to_a <- function(){
  a <- 20
}
assign_value_to_a()
print(a)
```

--

* What do you think will be printed at the end?

---
# Environment
* Let's do one more

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}

add_two_values <- function(x){
  x+y
}
print(add_two_values(10))
```
--

* What do you think will be printed at the end?

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}

y <- 10
print(add_two_values(10))
```
--

* What do you think will be printed at the end?
---
# Environment
* An **Environment** can be thought of as a collection of objects (functions, variables etc.). 
--

* An environment is created when we start the R interpreter. 
--

* Any variable we define, is now in this environment.
--

* The top level environment available is `R_GlobalEnv`.
--

* The `ls()` function shows what is in the current environment.
---
# Scope

* **Global variables** exists throughout the execution of a program. 
  * They can be changed and accessed from any part of the program
--

* **Local variables**  exist only within a certain part of a program like a function.
  * They are released when the function call ends.
  
--

* R uses **lexical scoping** to find a value associated with a name.
--

* If it can't find a value inside the function, it will look in the environment it was defined.
--

* The value of a global variable is not changed when calling a function, if you don't explicitly ask for it.

---
# Functions with side effects
* All functions in R return a value.

--
* Some functions also produce **side effects**:
  * Change variables in the current environment.
  * Plot graphics.
  * Load files.
  * Save files.
  
--

* Take care not to write functions that produce side effects, if that's not what you explicitly want.
